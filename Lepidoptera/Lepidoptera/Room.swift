    /*Create a room.
      Rooms should be generated according to heurestic rules:
      - Rooms should fall into a number of "types", with hybrids possible between some types.
        -> eg. Mechanical, or mechanical/waterlogged.
        -> for singly typed rooms, this means a distribution of related resources and enemies with minimums and maximums placed upon this.
        -> for hybrid rooms, this means a mix of both assets, with a ratio of maximum disparity at 30:70.
        -> If rooms are adjacent to any room, the chances of an adjacent room being of a similar type is increased.
        -> Some groups of rooms are fixed to be a set type (this may include setting rooms to be fixed as a hybrid type
      - Rooms should have a shape, and this shape should be selected from a list of possible types, however all shapes should be "fuzzed" by a random value to produce variations in shape.
        -> eg. Square, elliptical, long
        -> Fuzz value range from 0 to 0.5, dictates the chance of an edge tile generating an additional tile on any empty space. Capped at 50% to avoid unreasonable fuzziness.
